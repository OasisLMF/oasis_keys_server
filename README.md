A Flask application used to implement Oasis model keys servers.

The package documentation can be found at https://oasislmf.github.io/oasis_keys_server/.

## First steps

After cloning the repository (see the GitHub instructions on repository home page) and entering the repository folder you should install the package requirements using

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    
(You may need to omit the `sudo` if you are in a virtualenv.)

Provided that `sys.path` contains the absolute path to the repository folder you can now import the package or its components in the normal way.
