=====================

Cloning the repository
----------------------

You can clone this repository from GitHub using HTTPS or SSH, but it is
recommended that that you use SSH: first ensure that you have generated
an SSH key pair on your local machine and add the public key of that
pair to your GitHub account (use the GitHub guide at
https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/). Then
run

::

    git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/OasisLMF/oasis_keys_server

To clone over HTTPS use

::

    git clone https://github.com/OasisLMF/oasis_keys_server

You may receive a password prompt - to bypass the password prompt use

::

    git clone https://<GitHub user name:GitHub password>@github.com/OasisLMF/oasis_keys_server
